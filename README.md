# Todo Rest Api



## Description


I will create RestAPI in domain driven design.

There are three points to concentrate.

1. Trim the bounded context cleanly.
1. Make the foundation easy to implement function.
1. To develop with test first.

I will study about architecture.


## Features


- Authentication / Authorization
- Todo list
- Todo item crud
- Todo change history
